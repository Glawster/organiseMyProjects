# GUI Naming Linter Help

This tool checks Python GUI code for compliance with common readability and consistency standards.

## âœ… What It Checks

- **Function formatting**: functions with >4 logical lines must have a blank line after the def line.
- **UI layout**: detects if `statusLabel` and `progressBar` are placed in the same grid cell with identical layout settings.
- **Widget naming conventions**: ensures naming consistency for buttons, labels, and more.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### CLI
Run this from the command line:
```bash
runLinter path/to/your_script.py
```

### Programmatic
```python
from organiseMyProjects.guiNamingLinter import lintFile
lintFile("your_script.py")
```

## ðŸ“‹ Output
The linter will report:
- Line number
- Type of violation
- Function or widget name where applicable

## ðŸ›  Notes
- Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed.
- Add more checks to `guiNamingLinter.py` as your project grows.
